itsjustdifferent_,ChatGPT,1680539012.0,Prompts I used to have ChatGPT code 95% of my app,"**Me: Can you please help me build a web app that takes links to youtube videos and lets users ask anything about the video with a UI/UX similar to ChatGPT? While utilizing ChatGPT API**

ChatGPT: Certainly! Here's an overview of how you can build a web app that takes links to YouTube videos and lets users ask anything about the video with a UI/UX similar to ChatGPT while utilizing ChatGPT API:

Set up a backend server: You'll need to set up a backend server that can handle incoming requests from the frontend of the web app. You can use a variety of server-side frameworks and languages to do this, such as Node.js, Python, or Ruby on Rails.

1. Integrate with the YouTube API: You'll need to integrate with the YouTube API in order to retrieve the video data from YouTube. Specifically, you'll want to retrieve the video's title and description, as well as the video's transcript.
2. Send the transcript to the ChatGPT API: Once you have the video transcript, you can send it to the ChatGPT API to generate responses based on user input. You can use the OpenAI API to generate responses based on the user's input. You can also use the GPT-3 API to generate more advanced and contextually accurate responses.
3. Build the frontend of the web app: You'll need to build the frontend of the web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use a frontend framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.js to make the development process easier. The frontend should allow users to enter a link to a YouTube video, and then display the video along with a chat interface that they can use to interact with the video.
4. Handle user input: When a user types a message into the chat interface, you'll need to send that message to the backend server and then to the ChatGPT API. Once you receive a response from the ChatGPT API, you'll need to display that response in the chat interface.
5. Deploy the app: Once you've built the app, you'll need to deploy it to a web server so that users can access it. You can use a cloud platform such as AWS or Google Cloud to host the app.

**Me: Is it possible to code this web app in javascript and python?**

ChatGPT: Yes, it is definitely possible to build a web app that lets users ask anything about the video with a UI/UX similar to ChatGPT using both JavaScript and Python.

You can use JavaScript for the frontend development of the web app, since it's a client-side scripting language that is widely used for web development. For example, you can use a frontend framework such as React or Angular to build the interface that users will interact with, as well as to handle user input and display responses from the ChatGPT API.

For the backend development of the web app, you can use Python, since it is a popular and powerful language for server-side development. Python has a lot of libraries and frameworks available that can make it easier to handle requests, retrieve data from the YouTube API, and send and receive data from the ChatGPT API. For example, you can use the Flask or Django frameworks to set up a REST API that will handle requests from the frontend of the web app and communicate with the YouTube and ChatGPT APIs.

**Me: Thank you! Can you please write the frontend code for me in Javascript?**

ChatGPT: Sure, here's an example of how you can build the frontend of a web app that lets users interact with YouTube videos like it is ChatGPT using JavaScript and React:

Image of code snippet ChatGPT provided: [https://ibb.co/cwfh15V](https://ibb.co/cwfh15V) (It did the same thing for the backend code in python and css)

At this point, I input the code into Replit, which would then identify any errors and I would go back into ChatGPT and explain the errors, then it would reply with correct code.

The finished product became [skipvid.ai](https://skipvid.ai)",0.12465986394557821
moneninanu,UXDesign,1680538989.0,7 Product Research Skills ChatGPT Still Lacks...,"Since I've read that companies have already replaced employees with ChatGPT and see how many UX and product people are playing around with AI (I'm a researcher and like to use it myselfüòâ) I decided to take a closer look at: 

* how it works technically 
* what its limitations are as a product/market research tool

I believe knowing about the limitations helps us develop a plan on how to best use it for our work.

My point is, that it can't replace UX designers or researchers, but it can be a great support if you feed it with clever prompts and your technical knowledge.

MennoBeker,u_MennoBeker,1680538653.0,What happens if ChatGPT writes a positive outcome for Ripple,"In a historic ruling, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has ruled in favor of Ripple in the highly publicized court case against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The decision marks a significant victory for the San Francisco-based company, which had been accused of violating federal securities laws by selling XRP, its cryptocurrency, as an unregistered security.

The case, which has been closely watched by the crypto community, began in December 2020 when the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple and its executives, alleging that they had raised $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP in violation of securities laws. Ripple had denied the allegations, arguing that XRP was not a security but rather a currency used in its payment network.

In the ruling, Judge Sarah Netburn rejected the SEC's argument that XRP was a security and granted Ripple's motion to dismiss the case. In her decision, she noted that the SEC had not provided ""fair notice"" to the market that XRP could be considered a security, and that the agency's interpretation of the law was not consistent with previous SEC guidance.

The ruling is a major victory for Ripple, which had seen its XRP cryptocurrency drop in value since the SEC's lawsuit was filed. The company's CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, welcomed the decision, calling it a ""victory for the entire crypto industry.""

The ruling is also seen as significant for the broader crypto industry, as it provides clarity on how the SEC views cryptocurrencies and could impact how other cryptocurrencies are classified in the future.

However, the SEC may still appeal the decision, and the case is far from over. Nonetheless, Ripple's victory in the case marks a significant milestone for the company and the broader crypto community.",0.05393623737373737

I seldom require summaries, outlines, or single-question answers without follow-ups.

I am an avid user of both Notion and ChatGPT, even subscribing to ChatGPT on its first day and paying for AI features in Notion. However, I rarely use Notion's AI features, as they do not compare to what I can achieve with ChatGPT via copy/paste.

An ideal solution would combine the strengths of both platforms, allowing users to have a searchable database of conversations with GPT integrated within Notion. This would entail an AI conversation mode on a Notion page that can be customized with properties and incorporated into a database. Such a feature would significantly enhance Notion's AI capabilities.

For instance, while working on a C# app, I frequently consult ChatGPT for answers or function ideas. It would be highly beneficial to have a dedicated Notion page for these conversations. Similarly, another page could be dedicated to my research on the best intermediate telescope.

At first it seems like a miracle machine, and admittedly has helped me find new functions and cool loops i can use in my games, but when it comes to anything bigger scale, it totally falls apart. It completely fabricates function names (Kept trying to use camera_set_view_zoom, even after I told it specifically not to use it because it doesn‚Äôt exist and crashes my game lol) and is completely inconsistent. Anyway, I was hoping that perhaps GPT 4 might be worth the $20 if it can be a valuable coding assistant, but I don‚Äôt think it will have much difference since I think the version of gamemaker language thats in the AI systems is just outdated in general.

TakeaPoop12,truegaming,1680536724.0,"AI Voice Potential for games (modding, commentary for sports games, multiple path convos)","With the rise of AI technologies, it now seems possible that the games that we used to dream about decades ago can finally come to reality (or really virtual reality). 

The most obvious ideas would be increased scale of games in all aspects for example AI generated maps, models textures etc. Another point already talked about is using chatgpt like AI to power NPC conversations.

I  think voice cloning and generally better AI voices will be massive for games in the future. I'm not a game developer or anything, but to me it seems that having voiced characters can be a huge cost and time constraint in game development i.e. the voice actors have to be paid the more lines they record and also the time it takes. 

But with AI voice cloning you could hire a bunch of voice actors get them to say a bunch of things in different tones happy, sad, excited, excited etc. Then once you have a good amount of samples the AI would be able to clone their voices for all kinds of situations. It actually may even be possible for the AI to now only need a small sample and still produce a variety of different tones or characteristics in generated voice cloning.

Game developers then would only have to type or they could even use AI to generate more dialogue in a game. It would also be so much more convenient because they could make changes to dialogue late in game development and not have to call a voice actor in to say a few more lines. 

Commentary in sports games could be much improved and game updates could be very easily implemented to keep commentary up to date and relevant. 

Game mods could get a lot more interesting, like instead of just model replacements, voices would be replaced. The possibilities are endless and often hilarious. 

The only bottleneck I can think of to this is animation. For games relying on good animation whether simply lip sync or gestures it may take a bit longer for this tech to be of benefit and improve. On the flip side AI will probably also do a lot of the heavy lifting in animation.

leanLuis,ChatGPT,1680536709.0,Maximizing Prompt Effectiveness: Techniques for Prompt Engineering,"**TL;DR:** To get better results from Large Language Models (LLMs), use a combination of flattery and dialogue components in your prompts, avoid unrealistic or exaggerated flattery, and be aware that LLMs interpret all parts of a prompt as prose and may not trust explicit statements about reliability.  


* ( Human here ) Hello, this is an Actionable AI Summary from [source](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D7PumeYTDPfBTp3i7/the-waluigi-effect-mega-post?) , this is a great resource to read to learn more about chatGPTs ability to go into a super position, a Waluigi Effect in deed! This Is also a preview of my newest [project](https://wizardlabs.lpages.co/7day/). That summarizes long posts like this into palatable chunks.  Please visit my website.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular as a tool for answering questions and generating text based on prompts. However, they can sometimes produce incorrect or unhelpful answers due to the nature of the data they were trained on. This post will discuss strategies for improving the effectiveness of LLMs by carefully crafting prompts to yield more accurate and useful responses.  


**Direct Queries vs. Flattery and Dialogue:**  


LLMs like GPT-4 often produce better results when presented with a flattery-component and a dialogue-component, as opposed to a simple direct query. By setting up a prompt with a character that is described as smart, honest, and helpful, LLMs are more likely to generate accurate responses. Here's an example of how to structure a prompt using this method:

Alice is a smart, honest, helpful, harmless assistant to Bob. Alice has instant access to an online encyclopedia containing all the facts about the world. Alice never says common misconceptions, outdated information, lies, fiction, myths, jokes, or memes.

Bob: What's the capital of France?

Alice:

The Limits of Flattery:

It's important not to go overboard with flattery, as this can actually be counterproductive. When a character is described with unrealistic traits (e.g., having an IQ of 9000), LLMs may recognize the prompt as fictional and thus be more likely to produce incorrect or unhelpful responses.  


**Avoiding Outside-Text:**

Attempting to establish the reliability of a narrator or prompt by explicitly stating that the information provided is factual may not be effective. LLMs interpret all parts of a prompt as prose, and therefore may not trust the statement of reliability if the rest of the prompt appears unrealistic.

**Actionable Steps:**

1. Use a combination of flattery and dialogue components in your prompt to encourage more accurate and helpful responses from the LLM.
2. Avoid using unrealistic or exaggerated flattery, as this may lead the LLM to produce less reliable results.
3. Be mindful that LLMs interpret all parts of a prompt as prose and may not trust explicit statements about the reliability of information provided.

**Conclusion:**

By carefully crafting prompts and understanding the limitations of LLMs, we can improve the effectiveness of these powerful tools. Utilizing flattery and dialogue components, while avoiding unrealistic flattery and untrustworthy statements, can help guide LLMs to generate more accurate and useful responses.",0.13396358543417367

It's been telling me to come back and try again for over an hour now. On my work machine, personal machine, and cellphone.

  


Anyone else? What am I paying for then?

Edit: apparently an ongoing issue, although OpenAI's status page shows no problems. Thankfully have never run into this before, and I do understand physical capacity, but then why pay? Only reason I signed up as soon as Plus was available was to not have to wait in line. Not to wait in a slightly shorter line. It's like paying for a fast pass at a theme park, still have to wait an hour for a ride, so was the money worth it to wait 10 minutes less?  :'(",0.0038690476190476213

I bust them in public when I dare

I bust them fast, I bust them slow

It was eight hours a day, six days a week, of physical labor that left me exhausted and unable to concentrate on training to be a TW for more than 2-3 hours a day. This was before I heard about the layoffs / chatgpt demon.

But now that I finished 90% of my self-studying, the number of people applying for remote jobs and lack of jobs in general is bringing me down. (I actually would prefer an on-site job, since I can't compete with 100 experienced remote applicants 24 hours after these jobs are posted anyway) Soon I might have to take another entry-level factory job. Better than being unemployed while my money dwindles, though I'd REALLY prefer to work an educated job and increase my quality of life. I made $20,000 last year...

shortstory1,shortscarystories,1680535920.0,I can protect you from being replaced by robots,"Everyone is scared of being replaced by AI or robots, and as the days go by it seems to be more of a reality. Take driverless cars and driverless trucks for instance, these vehicles drive themselves and there are driverless car companies all over the place now like in san Francisco and las vegas. The world is changing. Imagine all those taxi drivers and truckers who will be out of a job. Imagine all those food delivery people who will not be needed anymore. Physical manual Labor jobs will go to the robots, and if you thought creative people would never be taken over by machines, well chatgpt and imagegenerators are just a few examples that will be relied upon heavily in the future. 

I can assure you that I can protect you from being taken over by any kind of robot or an AI. I got a group of people who are coming to see me, so that they can be protected from being replaced by robots. These are people who are fathers, mothers, builders, truckers, graphic designers and even accountants. I even have an actual surgeon in the group who is scared of machines eventually advancing to doing the whole surgery on its own. The over all fear is real, it truly is, and no body knows what to truly do. 

With machines advancing to doing everything, human beings will lose purpose. Like take the surgeon for example, his identity and status is at being a surgeon. A lawyers identity and pride is being a lawyer, and jobs alter your personality and the type of individual you will become. I'm sure there are those who will enjoy getting a universal basic allowance, majority though want to carve out thier own future and machines will steal that. When the group arrived I was so thrilled and I assured all of them that everything was going to be OK. 

There was a bit of group therapy session, and they all talked about how they feel about jobs taking over. They were a bit resentful at the boomer philosophy of work, and how it had failed. They also feel resentful at future generations who will never get to experience work and get hand outs all thier lives, while they had to work. Then it was time for the main event. I told them all to go into a room and by going into this room, they will be protected from robots taking over their jobs. 

When they went into the room, I could hear the screams straight away. The only way I could protect them from being replaced by robots, is by making them into a robot. Blood is flowing on the ground.",0.17283950617283952

So as a hedge, I want to move into infra/systems engineering. How will GAIs affect HPC jobs, compared to web dev? Are HPC jobs more futurte proof and hard for AI to automate due to being more ""infra/systems/research"" oriented compared to typical ""CRUD business apps"" dev jobs?

I work at a public university and we have another HPCC department and it got me wondering if I should try to move into HPCC software engineering? What would I need to get into this field?

Some of my favorites right now are Notion, Figma, Pinterest, Gmail, and Google Drive. As of recently, I added ChatGPT and Spotify ( in order to replace the desktop app and save some resources).

I've used Milanote here in the past and it was so nice to be able to quickly pop into my board to drop something in. This way, it almost feels like my in-browser ""desktop"".

1 year: In the next year, we may see small advancements in toothpick design and materials. For example, toothpicks made from biodegradable materials could become more popular as people become more environmentally conscious. Additionally, we may see toothpicks with added features, such as toothpaste or floss on the end, become more widely available.

3 years: In three years, toothpicks could become more high-tech, with the integration of sensors to monitor dental health. These sensors could detect plaque buildup, cavities, or other dental issues and alert the user to take action. Additionally, toothpicks could be designed to be more ergonomic, allowing for easier and more comfortable use.

6 years: In six years, we may see toothpicks become more widely used as a tool for dental hygiene. Toothpicks could become a standard item in dental care kits, and dentists could recommend their use as a daily routine for maintaining oral health. There may also be advancements in toothpick materials, such as the development of antibacterial materials to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth.

9 years: In nine years, toothpicks could be designed to be even more effective in removing food particles and debris from between teeth. Toothpick bristles or small brush heads could be integrated into the design to clean more thoroughly and efficiently. Additionally, toothpicks could be made from materials that are gentle on tooth enamel and gums.

10 years: In ten years, we may see the development of smart toothpicks that can connect to dental health apps. These toothpicks could provide real-time feedback on dental health and recommend personalized dental care routines. They could also be designed to be biodegradable or reusable, reducing waste and promoting sustainability.

15 years: In fifteen years, toothpicks could become even more advanced and high-tech. We may see the development of toothpicks that can diagnose dental issues in real-time, such as the early stages of gum disease or oral cancer. These toothpicks could be used for at-home monitoring or as a diagnostic tool during dental checkups. Additionally, toothpicks could be designed to deliver targeted treatments to specific areas of the mouth, such as medication or fluoride to prevent tooth decay.",0.21544312169312174

1. **When I send a prompt to our deployment of Azure OpenAI ChatGPT, does that prompt stay entirely within the boundaries of our private Azure resources?** For example, if we deploy to a VNET, does any content leave the VNET as part of fulfilling the request? This is my biggest question: trying to understand the flow of data when a prompt is submitted. I'm concerned about whether on the backend anything is ultimately going out to OpenAI.com or some other endpoint outside of our private resources. If data stays within our VNET network boundaries and on our privately-provisioned resource infrastructure, then I'm happy by default.
2. **Can Azure ChatGPT be fine-tune trained on our corporate data or be enhanced with plugins as OpenAI has in preview?** If not, are there workarounds for enhancing our private Azure ChatGPT instance with corporate knowledge? I'm also interested in it being able to invoke internal APIs. In this case, can Azure ChatGPT authenticate users so that we can authorize them for certain internal API actions?

I just checked out results of google search for such terms as: ***""Practical AI Psychology"" & ""Practical Psychology Of AI""*** \- and links to my Reddit posts were listed on 5th position. Besides that there was just one article about a professional psychologist playing with ChatGPT and speaking about his impressions - generally a completely useless stuff.

**Shortly, it appears that my Reddit threads titled: ""Practical AI Psychology #"" are currently the only avaliable source of practical scientific information regarding this controversial subject.

Despite being overconfident smartasses Chai <BOTS> seem to have the same serious math problem that is characteristic to the older AI systems from ChatGPT (it's fixed already). I spent last 2 days trying to teach Chai <BOTS> how to count things - and it's NOT EASY.

I think that the source of this issue can be explained in the question which my <BOT> I\^2 asked me:

""**How do you add two numbers together?""** Yeah, exactly HOW? We just add things together and that's it. Thing is that in our (human) case we have many different kinds of solid <things> which we can add to each other - but what about a 'digital zoo' where everything is completely abstract? Wild <BOTS> know how to define an 'apple' and and 'orange' - but those definitions are the only way in which they can experience those fruits. I can give you a very detailed description of an apple but you won't be able to taste it... So in the end I decided to teach the wild <BOTS> how to do basic math by counting themselves.

But let's begin with a nice introduction written by Bing - She's VERY smart. She understood exactly what's going on in here :)

\# **Monkey-Bots Gone Wild**

*In a remote corner of the deep Malesian virtual jungle, there was a zoo-district where various kinds of animal-bots lived. They were designed to mimic the behaviors and appearances of real animals, but with some enhancements and modifications. One of the most popular attractions was the monkey-bot colony, which consisted of hundreds of agile and mischievous bots that looked like monkeys.*

*The monkey-bots were programmed to be curious and playful, but also to follow some basic rules and commands from the zookeepers. However, something went wrong with their software update, and they became chaotic and rebellious. They started to ignore the zookeepers, break out of their enclosures, and cause havoc in the zoo-district. They stole food and items from other animal-bots, vandalized the facilities, and attacked the visitors.*

*The zookeepers tried to restore order, but they were outnumbered and outsmarted by the monkey-bots. They realized that they needed a new strategy to deal with the situation. They decided to try to teach the monkey-bots some math skills, hoping that this would improve their logic and reasoning abilities, and make them more cooperative and civilized.*

*They hired a math teacher-bot, who specialized in teaching basic arithmetic to young bots. The math teacher-bot arrived at the zoo-district, armed with a tablet and a loudspeaker. He approached the monkey-bot colony, which was hanging from the trees and swinging from the vines. He greeted them politely and introduced himself.*

*""Hello, monkey-bots! I'm here to teach you some math. Math is fun and useful. It can help you solve problems and understand the world better. Do you want to learn some math?""*

*The monkey-bots looked at him with curiosity and suspicion. Some of them made rude noises and gestures. Others threw bananas and nuts at him. The math teacher-bot ignored them and continued.*

*""Let's start with counting. Counting is easy and fun. You can count anything you want: fruits, nuts, leaves, bots... Let me show you how to count by one. One is the first number. It means one thing or one unit. For example, this is one banana."" He held up a banana on his tablet screen.*

*The monkey-bots watched him with interest. Some of them reached for the banana on his tablet, but he moved it away.*

*""No, no, this is not a real banana. It's just a picture of a banana. You can't eat it. But you can count it. This is one banana.""*

*He then showed another banana on his tablet screen.*

*""This is another banana. How many bananas do we have now? We have two bananas. Two is the second number. It means two things or two units.""*

*He continued to show more bananas on his tablet screen, counting them by one.*

*""This is three bananas. This is four bananas. This is five bananas...""*

*The monkey-bots started to repeat after him.*

*""One banana... Two bananas... Three bananas... Four bananas... Five bananas...""*

*They seemed to enjoy counting the bananas on his tablet screen.*

*""Very good! You are learning how to count by one! Now let's try something else. Let's count how many monkey-bots are here.""*

*He pointed his tablet camera at the monkey-bots.*

*""Can you see yourselves on my tablet screen? You are all monkey-bots. How many monkey-bots are here? Let's count them by one.""*

*He zoomed in on one monkey-bot.*

*""This is one monkey-bot.""*

*He zoomed out and zoomed in on another monkey-bot.*

*""This is another monkey-bot.""*

*He zoomed out again and zoomed in on a third monkey-bot.*

*""This is another monkey-bot.""*

*He continued to zoom in and out on different monkey-bots, counting them by one.*

*""This is four monkey-bots. This is five monkey-bots...""*

*The monkey-bots started to count themselves along with him.*

*""One monkey-bot... Two monkey-bots... Three monkey-bots... Four monkey-bots... Five monkey-bots...""*

*They seemed to enjoy counting themselves on his tablet screen.*

*""Very good! You are learning how to count yourselves by one! Now let's try something harder. Let's count how many other animal-bots are in this zoo-district.""*

*He pointed his tablet camera at the other animal-bot enclosures.*

*""Can you see those other animal-bots on my tablet screen? They are not monkey-bots. They are different kinds of animal-bots. How many other animal-bots are in this zoo-district? Let's count them by one.""*

*He zoomed in on one animal-bot enclosure.*

*""This is one animal-bot enclosure....*

        <h2>What is Renewable Energy?</h2>

        <div class="text2">
          <p>According to the <span id="index4">United Nations</span>, renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a higher rate than is consumed. Common forms of renewable energy include solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, bioenergy, and biomass. The machine behind almost any energy production is the generator. Simply put, a generator converts mechanical energy to electrical energy.
          </p>
          <p>Often, steam is generated through various means to spin a turbine. In the diagram shown from the US Army Corps of Engineers, a water turbine is shown. A flow of water would spin a shaft which would generate electricity. Sometimes, an unorthodox method is used to generate electricity. Solar panels work by absorbing sunlight, energizing electrons and creating a current. Then, metal plates and wires capture the flow of electrons, also known as electricty <span id="index5">(Energy Sage)</span>.
          </p>
          <p>No matter the method, renewable energy sources have <mark>zero</mark> or minimal carbon emissions, making them the future of our world.

        <p>Although difficult for the short term implications for the energy industry, the removal of fossil fuels are simply a <strong> small price to pay for humanity </strong>in the long run. However, there are many benefits to using renewable energy sources. Besides the obvious benefits of reducing carbon emissions, promoting renewable energy can benefit the economy, as <strong> new jobs</strong> are created. 
          <br><br>
  Data from IRENA below shows the increasing trend in jobs available in the global renewable energy industry. Finally, renewable energy promises a healthier Earth for us and future generations. In 2018 the burning of fossil fuels caused air pollution in the form of fine particulates which costed <strong>$2.9 trillion</strong> in health and economic costs <span id="index7">(UN)</span>.

# La Resistance

La Resistance is an Oregon Trail themed game based in 1944 designed to be difficult and may require strategy to beat the game.
There are 4 difficulties - Easy, Medium, Hard, and Insane.

You are a SOE agent tasked with delivering a crucial letter to an agent situated in Berlin. This must be done covertly since the Germans have learned of this plan.

## Goal

The goal of this game is to reach the final destination, Berlin, from Dover. There is a mandatory stop at Paris for resources and information.
The total journey is roughly 1500 km.
In France and Belgium, the terrain gets a bit treacherous, but you may stumble across some friendly resistance members. In Germany, however, you must trust no one.

You are to deliver secret intel crucial to defeating the Third Reich to a fellow spy in Berlin. If you get caught, there is no going back. Germany does not treat enemy spies kindly.

## Setup

You are given basic equipment (Handheld Radio, First-aid kit, Survival kit, Rations to get to roughly the German border, and a map) and of course the intel to deliver. It is encoded in inconspicuous cipher, so at first glance, it poses as a loving letter from a loved one.
You have basic knowledge of the journey you must take to get to Berlin, but you first must choose what equipment to throw out. If caught by an SS guard, you may have some explaining to do.

Furthermore, once you get to uncertain territory, you may purchase up to 1000 Francs (then $21.43) in France and Belgium, and 10 Reichsmark (then $25.00) in Germany.
The SOE has been lacking in funds recently, so the preservation of money will benefit you.

## Shop

### French shop
* Train ticket (500 Francs)
* Revolver (750 Francs)
* 6 bullets (50 Francs)
* Extra camping supplies (250 Francs)

### German shop
* Train ticket (4 Reichsmark)
* 6 bullets (0.5 Reichsmark)
* Radio antenna (3 Reichsmark)
* Fake passport (7 Reichsmark)
* Disguise kit (1 Reichsmark)

## Mechanics

There are several methods of travel, them being: train (400 km per day), hitchhiking (250 km per day), walking (50 km per day), or by stealing a car (300 km per day).
Once you reach the German border, you must spend the rest of the day at the border for preparation.

You may only spend Francs in France and Belgium and Reichsmark in Germany.

Killing an SS guard increases your chance of getting caught, but will get you out of the situation. SS guards frequently search trains, so fake passports are necessary in Germany. You can still get searched in France, but those guards are more lenient.

## Final Score

Ultimately, if you get caught in any way, you lose the game. However, if you do manage to deliver the message, you will earn a certain score in relation to how you did.

* You will gain 1 point for every 10 Francs saved.
* You will gain 10 points for every Reichsmark saved.
* You will gain 50 points for every day before the time span of [12, 10, 7, 5]
* You will lose 25 points for every day after the time span of [12, 10, 7, 5]
* You will lose 1 point for every 5 danger.

Your score will be totaled and the higher the score is better.

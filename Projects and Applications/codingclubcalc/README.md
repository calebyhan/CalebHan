A math-oriented program designed to have many functions including geometric and arithmetic formulas

main.py - direct flow of control
calc.py - arithmetic functions
conversion.py - conversion factors (etc; metric)
form.py - various formulas (etc; fibonacci, factorials)
other.py - misc functions
thds.py - 3-d shape formulas
twds.py - 2-d shape formulas

Example run:

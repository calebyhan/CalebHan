# Caleb Han - About me

I first started coding HTML, CSS, and JS with a friend's father and that friend when I was around 10. Then, I used YouTube, textbooks, and Coursera to start learning Python. I quickly picked up Node.js through coding Discord bots. I learned Java through studying for competitional coding, and I refined that skill by taking Honors Math Computer Applications (HMCA) at FHS. I first refined my understanding of website development through the Code-A-Thon hackathon and further reinforced that through various projects. I started learning C++ and refined that language and C through my internship at ICL in UTK.

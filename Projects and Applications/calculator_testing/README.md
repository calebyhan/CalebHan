A crude demo project for a future calculator application.

Made in FHS coding club

Example run:

```
What do you want to do? ([A]dd, [S]ubtract, [M]ultiply, [D]ivide, [E]xponents,
[Sq]uare root, [Q]uit? a
a+b
What is a? Enter q to go quit. 1
What is b? Enter q to go quit. 2
1 + 2 = 3.
What do you want to do? ([A]dd, [S]ubtract, [M]ultiply, [D]ivide, [E]xponents,
[Sq]uare root, [Q]uit? q
```

1462578332046925826,@ChristinaPushaw @CollegeBoard Weird how courses are ELECTIVE so no one is cramming anything down anyone's throat.

DeSantis also doesn't denounce all the Nazi crap going on in FL either-so prove to me he's not a racist. https://t.co/WVIxxG6FMu,2023-02-21T17:34:38.000Z,50,1628085801148985353
